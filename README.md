## 🚀 About Me

I’m a data engineer and analytics engineer focused on building **production-minded data systems**, **end-to-end ML pipelines**, and **analytics workflows** that solve real problems. My background bridges healthcare operations and machine learning, allowing me to design solutions that are technically sound and practically impactful.

I value clarity, reproducibility, and engineering discipline. My goal is to deliver work that feels intentionally crafted and *mid-level*.

Current areas of focus:

- Modular, production-style data pipelines  
- Healthcare ML with emphasis on **recall and clinical safety**  
- SQL + Python analytics engineering patterns  
- Strengthening my technical stack through advanced certifications

## 🧠 Core Skills

**Data Engineering & Analytics Engineering**  
- Python, SQL, ETL/ELT workflows, data modeling  
- PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, BigQuery  
- Pipeline architecture, reproducible project structures  
- CLI tools, Flask APIs, joblib model persistence  

**Machine Learning**  
- Supervised ML (classification, risk prediction)  
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)  
- Evaluation: AUC, recall, precision/recall prioritization  
- Visualization + interpretability (feature importance, thresholding)

**Visualization & Reporting**  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Tableau  
- Technical writing and structured documentation
